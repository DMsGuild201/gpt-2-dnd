ieu are you the only person you know I do not know you better now
  O the fool is this mad and mad with the first part of my mind
  Which he makes to hate what I do not know him now and when he puts this into

                                
  O the fishevery he
  Are you I am I was once a gentleman
  And I speak with the best of the French to him to set him down
  Upon my father's advice when he saw the same
  It was with a smile and a good smile
  And was with that smile like the picture
  Of his wife and his mistress to the end of her marriage
  Where were you when she married him
  And that smile where there is no eye to see it
  Is that she is dead
  That I met her again with a good smile
  That she was dead
  That I met her more with a smile and a good smile
  Wherefore I see she is dead
  And that smile is like the picture of her
  But she is dead again
  And that smile is not like to smile
   And that smile is like to smile 'twas that
  And that smile is like to smile 'twas that smile
  And this smile is like to smile
   And that smile is not like to grin 'twas not that
  And she's dead again

                                    Enter BESSER

    What was so with the lady
  Well I have heard she is dead
  It was with a smile she could move
  And that smile is like the picture
  And the lady herself is dead
  All she has to do is smile and to smile is
  The lady is dead
  And she's dead I should see her alive
  So did the lady's alive
  And so the lady dies too But her body remains
   In the coffin of my sister              Exeunt the Countenance
