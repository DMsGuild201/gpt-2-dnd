When the target\u2019s Constitution becomes 0, it dies and its soul is consumed by the Abyss. Creatures killed in this way can only be brought back to life by a Wish spell. Casting Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or a similar effect that removes curses or diseases undoes the Constitution loss and cures the target of Demon Fever."
